## Apollo-11 Repository Facts
- The comanche had two restart tables (even and odd)
- An original verb/noun software remained used throughout development without improvement
- The conic subroutines had limited range with which they could generate results, these ranges were exactly within the range of trajectories Apollo-11
was intended to meet.
