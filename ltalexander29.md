## Apollo-11 Repository Facts
- The comanche had two restart tables (even and odd)
- An original verb/noun software remained used throughout development without improvement
- The conic subroutines had limited range with which they could generate results, these ranges were exactly within the range of trajectories Apollo-11
was intended to meet.

## No-Code Repository Facts
- There is no code allowed in any repositories
- Any result meeting the guidelines will produce the same result - nothing.
- If a push contains code it will be rejected with the line "Code is a liability"
